# SciComp: Zane's Stuff for MATH 340 at WCU.
MATH 340: Intro to Scientific Programming is a course at Western Carolina University designed to introduced students (typically Math or CS majors) to several programming languages used for scientific computing.

Currently this repo contains:
* Kinetics: an activity, designed for R, which has students analyze and transform enzyme kinetics data. No knowledge of enzyme kinetics is needed, though a page of background information is provided for the curious. The activity is designed to help students understand data transformations and regression methods.

* constrained_max.nb: a Mathematica notebook showing several examples of how plots can be made in Mathematica. This example focuses on solving a constrained maximization problem both graphically and analytically, but the plotting techniques can be extrapolated. 

* Leslie Matrix Activity: An activity, designed for MATLAB, to introduce students to Leslie/Leftkovitch class-structured matrix population models. A lot of material was sourced from either my General Ecology class or Hal Caswell's book. Designed as an exploratory activity for students to dive in and see how things work for themselves.

* Fall 2019: All of the daily stuff I have made during class during the Fall 2019 semester.
