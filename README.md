# SciComp: Zane's Stuff for MATH 340 at WCU.
MATH 340: Intro to Scientific Programming is a course at Western Carolina University designed to introduced students (typically Math or CS majors) to several programming languages used for scientific computing.

Currently this repo contains:
* Kinetics: an activity, designed for R, which has students analyze and transform enzyme kinetics data. No knowledge of enzyme kinetics is needed, though a page of background information is provided for the curious. The activity is designed to help students understand data transformations and regression methods.

* constrained_max.nb: a Mathematica notebook showing several examples of how plots can be made in Mathematica. This example focuses on solving a constrained maximization problem both graphically and analytically, but the plotting techniques can be extrapolated.
