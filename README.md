# SciComp: Zane's Stuff for MATH 340 at WCU.
MATH 340: Intro to Scientific Programming is a course at Western Carolina University designed to introduced students (typically Math or CS majors) to several programming languages used for scientific computing.

Currently this repo contains:
* Kinetics: an activity, designed for R, which has students analyze and transform enzyme kinetics data. No knowledge of enzyme kinetics is needed, though a page of background information is provided for the curious. The activity is designed to help students understand data transformations and regression methods.

* constrained_max.nb: a Mathematica notebook showing several examples of how plots can be made in Mathematica. This example focuses on solving a constrained maximization problem both graphically and analytically, but the plotting techniques can be extrapolated. 

* LaTeX examples: Sample .tex and accessary (image and .bib) files needed for compiling. These are examples written live during class in order to cover concepts in TeX during the first part of the course during Fall 2019.

* Excel examples: Spreadsheets created in real-time along with the class to demonstrate Excel functions and basic modeling during Fall 2019.
